/**
 * Server-side wait-tile pre-computation pass.
 *
 * Walks an event stream once, folds it through `applyReplayEvent`,
 * and snapshots each seat's wait tiles after every event. Result is
 * a parallel array indexed by event position: `waitsByIndex[i][seat]`
 * is the seat's wait list at the state reached by applying events
 * `[0..i]` inclusive.
 *
 * The point of this pass is to keep the shanten engine on the
 * server. The replay loader runs once per page load; the client
 * renderer then reads `view.currentWaits` directly without ever
 * importing `~/utils/waitUtils` or the underlying shanten module.
 *
 * Seats not in a discard-decision state (3N or 3N+2 size where
 * `getWaits` rejects, hands of size 14 mid-turn, empty hands)
 * yield an empty list — semantics match the previous client-side
 * `computeCurrentWaits` helper exactly.

 * entries — entries where the state doesn't change waits (e.g.
 * `new_dora`, `match_start`) still get a snapshot; this keeps the
 * indexing trivial for the route component.
 *
 * Authoritative wait info from the platform replay log takes
 * precedence over the shanten-based fallback. Majsoul attaches
 * `tingpais` to every discard event (see `replayAdapter.ts`); when
 * present we lock that seat's waits to the platform-reported list
 * until the seat's hand changes again (draw / chi / pon / kan).
 * Tenhou and Riichi City don't expose per-discard waits, so those
 * seats keep using the local shanten compute throughout.
