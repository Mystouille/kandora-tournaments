/**
 * On-demand replay-log fetcher for the `/replays/:gameId` route.
 *
 * Background: the Phase 4.5 hydration cycle is what normally fills
 * the `replaylogs` collection — it walks the `games` collection and
 * calls `connector.getReplayLog(gameId)` for each game that doesn't
 * yet have a `replayLogRef`. That cycle only covers ids that already
 * belong to a registered league/tournament `Game` doc.
 *
 * This helper is the fallback path the replay route takes when a
 * user lands on a `gameId` that doesn't have a row yet: dispatch to
 * the right connector by source, fetch + parse the platform log,
 * upsert it into `replaylogs` (without any `Game` link — these are
 * "orphan" logs, fine for now), and return the freshly-parsed log
 * so the loader can render immediately.
 *
 * Source dispatch mirrors the production hydration code path in
 * `GameHydrationService.server.ts` — the only difference is we
 * don't have a `League` object handy, so we map the
 * `ReplaySource` enum onto the right connector singleton directly.
